# EAI  Evaluation for Alfred challenge

In section, we present how to evaluation three state-of-the-art model on Luminous generated scenes.

- MOCA
- ET
- HiTUT 

## Prerequisites

1. Build scenes from Unity Editor scenes and specify the *local_execution_path* in *eval_xx.py*. We provide the builded Unity executable file for Linux by this [link](???)

2. Get the trajectories path by setting *traj_root* in *eval_xx.py* generated by Luminous Task Solver. We also provide the set of Luminous generated trajectories by this [link](???).

The *eval_xx.py* can be *eval_et.py*, *eval_moca.py* or *eval_hitut.py* in the subfolders.
